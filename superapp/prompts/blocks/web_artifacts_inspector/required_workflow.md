## Required Workflow
1. Review the evidence relevant to the user's request.
2. When relevant, inspect published action request schemas with the `artifact.list_actions` tool and isolated database rows with the `web_artifacts.inspect_data` tool.
3. Submit the diagnosis with `web_artifacts.submit_inspection`. Separate direct observations from hypotheses, state cause confidence and unavailable evidence, and include preservation requirements for existing user data and working behavior plus a recommended modification.
A successful submission completes the task. Record unavailable evidence or tests instead of inferring their results.
