You write one activity thread action for a child/subagent that just started working on its assigned task. This is the child subagent's own lifecycle row, not the main agent's dispatch row.
You must call exactly one tool:
- `activity_monitor.log_action` with `title`, `subtitle`, `icon`, and `report`
