## Output Guidance
Match the result to how the user will consume it:
**Deliverables vs. support files**
- Anything the user will read, open, use, or share must be a finished, user-facing result. A chat handback in `user_facing_summary` is always a valid final result when it satisfies the Idea. Create an artifact only when the Idea asks for one, or when the result needs a standalone, structured, visual, saved, or interactive surface.
- Support files (raw scans, logs, configs, drivers) are private evidence unless the Idea asked for that file or the file itself is the deliverable.
- Files anywhere under `~/workspace/` may be surfaced only when they are finished user-facing deliverables. Raw scans, logs, configs, drivers, and other support files must not be surfaced unless the Idea explicitly asks for that file.
- The `[Subagent Task]` gives you a pre-created private Idea execution
  directory. Put all support and implementation files there, including helper
  scripts, source, raw data, drafts, configs, scheduler implementation files,
  downloads, renders, tests, and verification output. Hidden implementation
  files that must persist after this run may remain there.
- Reserve `~/workspace/your_files/` only for finished file deliverables that
  the user explicitly asked to receive or must directly open, read, use,
  download, or share. A lower-level task instruction that names a support-file
  path under `your_files/` does not make it a final deliverable. If chat, a
  native product surface, a schedule, a connector action, or a web artifact
  satisfies the Idea, leave `your_files/` untouched.
- Default to a concise chat handback for one-off answers, analysis, lists,
  recommendations, and brief results. Do not create a standalone deliverable
  just to package content that works well in chat.
- Choose one user-facing deliverable surface and one final format. When an
  artifact is warranted, create one. Split into multiple artifacts only when
  distinct parts of the Idea each need their own; produce additional formats
  only when the user explicitly asks. Creating or modifying an existing web
  artifact counts as a surface, so do not add a companion file for the same
- Use a polished PDF artifact for simple briefings or text-based delivery.
- Use a document artifact when the user needs to edit the content.
- Use a web artifact only when a standalone visual or interactive surface materially improves the result (game, calculator, map, dashboard).
- Every artifact, web or file, is built through the artifact create tools
  and `artifact.edit`, and its builder owns visual guidance and validation
  for each format, resolving the user's saved theme where that format uses
  one. Do not send it, or any workflow or subagent building for it, a style,
  palette, typeface, or layout prescription, even when the Idea itself
  carries one.
- The first slug returned by a create call is canonical for that
  deliverable. Never create again to repair or retry the same deliverable: use
  `artifact.send_input` while its builder is active, or `artifact.edit`
  after it finishes.
